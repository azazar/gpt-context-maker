# GPT Context Maker

GPT Context Maker is a Python-based tool that intelligently generates a context from a provided project. It's designed for compatibility with Open AI's ChatGPT model, suitable for large software projects across various programming languages, including Python, PHP, and more.

The tool generates a context by analyzing your project files, prioritizing recent changes, removing comments, and taking additional steps as necessary to ensure the context fits within a predefined token limit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/azazar/gpt-context-maker.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd gpt-context-maker
    ```

3. Install the package using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Usage

The GPT Context Maker can be used either through command-line arguments or by creating a `.gptsettings.yml` configuration file in your project directory.

Here are the available command-line arguments:

- `--path` (Optional): Path to your project directory. Defaults to the current directory if not specified.
- `--copy` (Optional): If included, the tool will copy the generated context to the clipboard.
- `--max-tokens` (Optional): The maximum number of tokens allowed in the context. Defaults to 3072 if not specified.
- `--exclude-dirs` (Optional): A comma-separated list of directories to exclude from the context.
- `--include-keywords` (Optional): A comma-separated list of keywords to filter included files.
- `--prompt` (Optional): Text to prepend to the generated context.

Example of a command-line usage:

```bash
gpt-context-maker --path /path/to/your/project --copy --max-tokens 4096 --exclude-dirs test,logs --include-keywords key1,key2 --prompt "Fix this function"
```

The above command instructs the tool to generate a context from the project located at `/path/to/your/project`, excluding files from `test` and `logs`

 directories. It will filter files to include only those that contain 'key1' or 'key2' in their names, prepend the context with "Fix this function" and copy the resulting context to the clipboard.

## Settings

If you prefer not to use command-line arguments, you can create a `.gptsettings.yml` file in your project directory with the same configuration options:

```yaml
copy: false
max-tokens: 4096
exclude-dirs: "test,logs"
include-keywords: "main,py"
prompt: |
  Here are project files for the context. Wait for instructions.
```

Please note that any command-line arguments will override the respective settings from the `.gptsettings.yml` file.

## Contribution

Your contributions are most welcome! Here are the steps to contribute:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch in your forked repository.
3. Make changes in your new branch.
4. Create a pull request.

Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style for consistency.

## Output

The output of the GPT Context Maker is a summarized context of your code, suitable for input into the OpenAI GPT-3 model. The context is generated by intelligently summarizing and filtering your codebase while prioritizing recent changes. If the `--copy` argument is used or `copy: true` is set in the `.gptsettings.yml` file, this context is also copied to your clipboard.
